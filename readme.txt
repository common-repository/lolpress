Allows the submission of any of post images to the Cheezburger Network

== Description ==

Once this plugin is activated, any image of class image-full or any image of class image-thumbnail which links to a larger image will get a tooltip popup on mouseover that will allow the image to be submitted for captioning to the Cheezburger Network. There is also a link in the tooltip popup that will allow a user to see all the captioned version of that image. 

When an image is submitted for captioning the blog admin will receive an email indicating that an image has been submitted to the Cheezburger Network.
